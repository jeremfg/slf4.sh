# slf4sh

Simple Logging Facade for Shell

## Install

### Using [bpkg (Bash Package Manager)](https://bpkg.sh/)

```bash
bpkg install jeremfg/slf4.sh
```

or

```bash
bpkg install -g jeremfg/slf4.sh
```

NOTE: bpkg itself can easily be installed by calling
`curl -sLo- https://get.bpkg.sh | bash`

In the first case, the library is installed local to your project.
You will need to `source deps/slf4.sh/src/slf4.sh`.
In the second case, the library is installed globally.
You will need to `source ~/.local/lib/slf4.sh`.

## Features

```bash
logTest()
logTrace()

You can either pass your log message as an argument,
or pipe straight into it. See examples below:

```bash

$(date)
$(hostname)

A lot of stuff happened!
EOF
```
